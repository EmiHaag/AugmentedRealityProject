# AugmentedRealityProject
Custom project to track parts in module and display errors detail on mobile screen application.

The PointerController.cs is the main class where a module is tracked with Augmented reality using Vuforia plugin, to display diagrams on the screen, detect each component for the module as well as show circuits.

Some files are hidden for legal property. 

This scripts capture a certain module, wich was previously tracked with vuforia database. 

We used Unity Editor for displaying and tracking images over the module. Those files are not in this repository, only the main scripts that handle all the logic.
